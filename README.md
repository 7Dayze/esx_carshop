# About esx_carshop:
Car Shop for ESX Servers that doesn't interfere with [esx_vehicleshop](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_vehicleshop)

I did NOT create the Code. I only edited the [esx_truckshop](https://github.com/HumanTree92/esx_truckshop) code.
This works just like [esx_vehicleshop](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_vehicleshop) but there is no option to enable a car dealer job.
I mostly made this so I can use [esx_vehicleshop](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_vehicleshop) for a custom cardealer and a car dealer on the side to sell cheaper / standard GTA vehicles.

# Requirements:
* Auto mode (everyone can buy vehicles from the dealer)
  * No need to download another resource

# Download & Installation:
1) Download the .zip.
2) Extract the .zip or Open the .zip.
3) Import `en_esx_carshop.sql` or `nl_esx_carshop.sql` in your database
4) Place `esx_carshop` in your ESX Directory
5) Add `start esx_carshop` to your server.cfg
